## About
I design and validate secure infrastructure and compliance-driven solutions. My work focuses on reliable, auditable delivery where configuration, testing, and documentation prevent issues from reaching end users. I operate across public- and private-sector environments with attention to governance, process, and operational quality.

I’m strongest in designing and building portable, validated CI/CD-driven solutions end-to-end. I may not own large-scale production environments yet, but I build systems that are ready to be taken there.
